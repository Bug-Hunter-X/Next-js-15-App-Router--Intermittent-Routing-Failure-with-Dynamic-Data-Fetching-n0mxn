# Next.js 15 App Router: Intermittent Routing Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching.  Under certain conditions, routes fail to render correctly, resulting in a blank page or an error.

## Bug Description

The issue is intermittent. It occurs unpredictably when navigating to dynamic routes that fetch data.  The page may render correctly sometimes, but other times it will fail, showing a blank screen or a server-side error.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to different dynamic routes (e.g., `/product/1`, `/product/2`, etc.).
5. Observe intermittent rendering failures.

## Expected Behavior

The page should render correctly and display the fetched data consistently.

## Actual Behavior

The page intermittently fails to render, displaying a blank screen or an error.

## Solution

A potential solution (provided in `bugSolution.js`) may involve adjusting the data fetching strategy, or implementing additional error handling to gracefully manage these unexpected failures.
